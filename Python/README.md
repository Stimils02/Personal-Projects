# CS307 Project: JudgeMe

## About
JudgeMe is a social network that uses your Spotify to connect your music taste with your friends' music taste. JudgeMe will give you a music taste value that you can compare with your friends. Along with that, JudgeMe can create playlists for you, give you a breakdown of your music taste, and break down artist statistics. 

This project was used as our project in CS 30700: Software Engineering at Purdue University. To see details of our engineering process, please visit the 'docs' directory.
