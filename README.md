# Personal-Projects

Welcome to the GitHub Repository. These are some of the example projects I have done over the years which I decided to keep in GitHub. There is some projects in development that will be uploaded to the github in the coming months.

The Dart project the some of the sample code for the NASA Api created that uses the APOD and Mars Rover API. These projects are for enjoyment and not to be deployed.
The Python project contains two projects, the JudgeMe Application and HomieTime Application which is a planner. There are a few other projets that are not visible here
because they need to remain private. As soon as I receive permission to release those projects, I can display them here. Enjoy!

1. System Monitor - Uses C++ and C to manage system processes and track system performance
2. RendezView - Full stack recommendation system application that uses Flask, ReachJS, Google Auth, Yelp API, and a few more tools that provide users with suggestions for activities in the area.
